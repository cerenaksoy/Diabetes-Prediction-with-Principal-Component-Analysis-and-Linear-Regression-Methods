# Diabetes-Prediction-with-Principal-Component-Analysis-and-Linear-Regression-Methods
A Linear Model Based on Principal Component Analysis for Disease Prediction article published in IEEE was carried out.
This project was implemented using Python. The dataset was created specifically for this project. First, Exploratory Data 
Analysis was applied to the dataset, which was prepared from 84 different individuals, and correlation between data was 
observed. Afterwards, Principal Component Analysis was applied to move the data to a different vector space and 
disease detection was performed using LRM.
